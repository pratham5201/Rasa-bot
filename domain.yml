  - text: Assets are resources with economic value owned or controlled by an individual,
      corporation or country. There is an expectation that these assets will provide
      a future benefit. Assets can be almost anything and can consist of laptops,
      vehicles, pieces of equipment, and so forth.An asset typically has a unique
      identifier to separate it from other assets, such as being in one location,
      having one owner, and so forth. For instance, you can think of it as a one to
      one relationship.
  utter_11:
  - text: Inventory are different than assets. Inventory consists of raw materials,
      work-in-process products, and finished goods that are considered to be the portion
      of a business's assets that are ready or will be ready for sale.The key point
      about inventory is that it has a multiple to one relationship. In other words,
      inventory is quantity based. For instance, you can have one type of inventory
      item but have multiples of it, and the number would be reduced, or increased
      at varying points throughout its usefulness to the business.Pretty simple, huh?

      record can be quite different. The following screenshot provides an example
      of what an inventory record and its fields of information typically consists

      wish to create.'

  - text: You just got a peek into a new group. We'll guide you through the configuration
      process so you can create one of your own.To create this group and its fields:1.
      Click to select your settingsicon, and then selectGroup Settings.2. ClickAdd
      New Group.3. Provide theNameof your choice (we recommend and are usingConsumablesin
      our example), and then clickSave.Once you clickSave, aFieldssection displays
      on your screen, allowing you to begin to add new fields.4. Navigate to theFieldssection,
      and then clickAdd New Field.5. Create and add the new field(s) you wish to add.Keep
      in mind that the selections on this screen change depending on what you choose.
      You would of course repeat the field creation process for all new fields you
      wish to create. (We're using ourQuantity on Handfield for our example below.)6.
      ClickSave and Close.Just like that, your new field has been created and saved.

  - text: Notifications are good because they keep us on track and in the know, especially
      with our busy schedules. Asset Panda realizes this and provides you with the
      ability to be notified whenever an item and its quantity reach a breaking point
      (set by you!).For example, say you've created a numeric field type forQuantity
      on Hand(shown below).1. Navigate to theQuantity on Handfield, and then selectNotifications.2.
      ClickNew Notification.3. Enter a name for your notification. (We've usedQuantity
      is Lowfor our example.)4. Set theSend onfield toNumeric.5. Decide yourNotificationtype.SelectingEmailwill
      require you to enterUsers who can view notificationand aSubject.6. Set theValue
      isasLess thanand then select your less than value number.You could also opt
      to select another field from the second drop-down menu rather than a specific
      number. It really all depends on the fields that you have created. For instance,
      we have aQuantity Minimumfield (shown in the first screenshot of this article).
      We could have selected that rather than an actual number.7. Add any other options
      you wish to add to your new notification.8. ClickSaveto save it.

      the settingsicon, and then selectGroup Settings.2. Locate your new group (we''re

      and then clickSave.We''ll now create an action that will remove a quantity from
      a specific item. Keep in mind that you can have as many fields as you like within
      the action but for our example, we will focus on when an item is being removed
      (by having a date time stamp to automatically capture this) and by how many
      (with a numeric field for the quantity removed).5. Scroll down to yourFieldssection

      example). (SeeCreate groups and fieldsif you need help or a reminder for how
      to create groups and fields.)Group:Select the Group that is being changed.Field:Select

      from two of our existingConsumablesGroup fields,Quantity on HandandQuantity
      Removed. We selected the (-), asking the new Change Field to remove the Quantity
      Removed from the Quantity on Hand.If a user does not have access to write to
      this field, should this field be updated:Users aren''t usually automatically
      given the ability to manually change certain fields. We recommend setting this

      questions from the action itself (Date RemovedandQuantity on Hand, etc.).You
      can customize your report to pull from all time or, you can get really specific
